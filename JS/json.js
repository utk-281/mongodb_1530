//! json ==> javascript object notation
//? json is language independent, and is widely used in api response and is mainly used for exchanging data between different applications(projects)

// ~ it is similar to js objects but here keys are enclosed in double quotes and here we cannot pass undefined, functions and date

//! don't give comma after last key-value pair

let jsonData = {
  name: "abc",
  age: 34,
};

//? BSON
